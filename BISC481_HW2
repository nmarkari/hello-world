a)In vitro experiments

#SELEX-seq
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4265583/
SELEX-seq captures moderate affinity binding sites in addition to high affinity ones.
Tries to fix specificity issue of SELEX, where some sequences are specific in vivo but bind to a diverse set of targets in vitro.

#Protein Binding Microarray (PBM)
Array has 60 bp DNA probes that contain all possible 9 or 10mers. 
Can also be used to find binding sites of greater length.
Provides high confidence estimates of binding preferences.

b)In vivo experiments
#ChIP-seq
1. Cross link TF's to their binding sites in vivo
2. Shear DNA via sonication
3. Precipitate desired TF-DNA complexes via an antibody
4. Unlink + purify DNA
5. Sequence
High sensitivity has a high cost.
Binding sites indicated by a high density of tags.

c) ChIP-seq cannot really tell strength of preference of TF's for a sequence, only whether it binds (binary).
ChIP-seq also relies on the cell to express the TF, so if you do the experiment under the wrong conditions, there may 
not be any bound sequences since the TF is not present. In contrast, in vitro experiments can tell affinity of a TF
for a particular sequence. However, they may not accurately reflect in vivo specificity because of cofactors influencing
in vivo specificity.
